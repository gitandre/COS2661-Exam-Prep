### 4.1 Tautologies and logical truth

#### 🧒 Explain to me like I am 10
Tautologies are like magic sentences in logic that are always true, no matter what! It's like saying "It's either raining or not raining." One of those has to be true, right?

#### 🎓 A formal explanation explained
A tautology in formal logic is a formula that is true under every possible interpretation or assignment of truth values. This means that it holds universally, irrespective of the truth or falsity of its atomic components.

#### 📖 Definition
A tautology is a formula \( \phi \) such that for every interpretation \( I \), \( I(\phi) = \text{True} \).

#### 📐 Example

\`\`\`text
Example 1: \( P \lor \lnot P \)  (Law of Excluded Middle)
Example 2: \( (P \land Q) \lor (\lnot P \lor \lnot Q) \)
\`\`\`

#### 💡 Hints/Tips/Rules
- Tautologies are important for proofs and logical reasoning.
- They act as the logical equivalent of a "universal truth."

#### 🎯 Why is it relevant and when to use it
Tautologies are foundational in logic because they're always true. They're often used in proofs and logical reasoning as steps that are undeniably true, making your argument stronger.

#### 📚 Symbols and notations used

| Name                  | Symbol                  | Description                                          |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Individual Constant   | \( ( a, b, c, \ldots ) \) | Symbols that uniquely identify specific objects      |
| Atomic Sentence       | \( ( P(a), Q(b), R(c) ) \) | Simplest form of sentences incorporating individual constants |

#### 📝 Summary of Key Point
Tautologies are formulas that are always true, regardless of the truth values of their components. They are fundamental in logical reasoning and proofs.
